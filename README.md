# ClinicalInformaticsMatchAlgorithm
Implements the Match Algorithm for the Clinical Informatics Fellowship program.  Loosely based on the NRMP match, it allows for programs to implement additional "constraints" based on resources.  For example, a program may have funding for 4 total spots, but 1 spot is reserved for a pediatrician, thus the program cannot accept more than one pediatrician.
